# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community.
There are a few ways you can help us improve.

## Opening an Issue

If you see something you would like changed, but you are not sure how to change
it, then submit an issue describing what you'd like to see.

## Working Locally

Before committing your contribution, install and then run the `pre-commit` tool to verify your work.
The `pre-commit` configuration for the GitHub repository instructs the tool to run the `yamllint`, `ansible-lint`, and `flake8` commands.

You can use the following steps to prepare `pre-commit` on your system:

1. Install the `pre-commit`, `yamllint`, `ansible-lint`, `flake8`, and `black` tools from packages that your operating system might provide or from `pip`.
2. Navigate to your local copy of the GitHub repository.
3. Install the `pre-commit` hooks for the project: `pre-commit install`

Git automatically runs `pre-commit` every time you commit your work.
You can also run `pre-commit` at any time by using the `pre-commit run --all` command from inside your local copy of the GitHub repository.

See the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) documentation for more details.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Prepare and submit pull requests as follows:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub and then clone it locally.
2. Create a branch named appropriately for the change you are going to make.
3. Make your code change.
4. If you are creating a role or a module, then add a test playbook in the `tests/test_playbooks/` directory.
5. Add a changelog fragment file in the `changelogs/fragments/` directory.
   See the [Changelogs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/development_process.html#changelogs) document for guidance.
6. Push your code change to your forked repository.
7. Use the GitHub web UI to navigate to the original repository https://github.com/herve4m/quay-collection/pulls (not your forked repository).
   Open a pull request.
8. All pull requests go to a validation process.
   Make sure to run `pre-commit` before submitting your code.

For more details of forks and pull request, see the [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)  and [How to create a pull request in GitHub](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github) documentations.
