herve4m.quay.quay_org
=========

This role creates an organization in Quay Container Registry.
In addition, it can creates user accounts, robot accounts, teams, default permissions, applications, and repositories for that organization.


Requirements
------------

The role accesses Quay Container Registry through its REST API.
To access the API, you can use a username and a password, or an OAuth access token.

The user account you use (or the user account associated with the OAuth access token) must have superuser permissions.

If you wish to use an OAuth access token, then you can create one as follows:

1. Log in to the Quay Container Registry web UI with a user account that has superuser permissions.
2. Use an existing organization or create a new one.
3. In the organization, create an application.
4. In the application, select the `Generate Token` menu.
5. Select the permissions to associate to the token.
   To be able to use all the role in the collection, select `Administer Organization`, `Administer Repositories`, `Create Repositories`, `Super User Access`, and `Administer User`.
6. Click `Generate Token`.
7. Copy and then paste the token string into the `quay_token` role variable.
